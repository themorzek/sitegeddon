Greetings, morzek here, this is my first repo on here and i'm new to GitHub. I'm not gonna be active here alot but maybe in the future. I'm not really into programming but coding html is pretty cool. 
I might add some more description here but later.

Hello! Welcome to the page where i test out html coding to do a few sites. This is mainly for practice i'm not sure if i'll keep coding. The main reason for this is my IT classes homework - basically a mini school project in the form of learning to code sites.
If you view the codes of my sites (idk if you can do that i'm new to github) feel free to comment any advice or criticism to the code or idk what i could change about the code, i'll always appreciate some tips. (i might not be active here alot)
Another reason i did this is to share the sites i make easier so that i can quickly show them to friends or something like that.
To put you in perspective for my experience with programming - i got some experience from doing neocities.org abit, i did like a 9 month course for Python [PyCharm] programming but basically got nothing out of it, i used some template site makers like wordpress and carrd.co and i also did some profile changing in SpaceHey. That should be it.
